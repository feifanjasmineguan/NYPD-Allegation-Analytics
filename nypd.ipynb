We will further use a permutation test to showcase that our model is accurate and fair using F-1 score as the metric. \n",

    "### Dataset\n",
    "* This dataset contains data on 12,000 civilian complaints filed against New York City police officers. \n",
    "* In order to predict the outcome of NYPD allegation, we will first build a baseline model using simple features and Sklearn pipelines. \n",
    "* Next, we will add in more features and some engineered features to further perfect the prediction model."

    "* I want to explore whether police complaints are handled with fairness and this feature is the best variable to reflect that. I want to explore whether certain conditions of the allegation would result in different allegation outcomes.\n",
    "    * I will transform the \"outcome_description\" variable to a binary classification.\n",

    "### Evaluation metric: F-1 Score\n",
    "* In this model, simple accuracy is not enough\n",
    "* In evaluating whether FN or FP are more detrimental, I decided that: letting a police officer with misconduct remain in force for more unjust police action is worse than the inconvenience caused by investigating police with proper conduct. Recall measures the proportion of positives correctly identified and penalize FN.\n",
    "    * However, simply focusing on the FN is not enough. Out of all the ones classified as positive (should be disciplined), we also want to make sure that we're not classifying too many good officers as needing discipline. That will diverge resources on actual police work and cause complaints within the department. \n",
    "    * Therefore I chose F-1 score to balance out the FP and FN and assess the model on its ability to predict bad officers while not inconveniencing too many good ones."

    "* Transforming outcome column\n",
    "    * The outcome I want to predict is the outcome of allegation. However, since the allegation_description columns encompasses many different types of allegation outcome, I decided to just separate them into actions taken vs. no actions taken.\n",
    "    * If the outcome contains \"No arrest\", it means that the allegation didn't go through, and I will represent it with a classification 0.\n",
    "    * For any other outcomes, there are certain actions taken against the accused, whether that be arrested, summoned or investigated, and I will represent it with a classification 1."

    "* Accuracy is misleading\n",
    "    * While accuracy can showcase the general performance of a prediction pipeline, if there is disproportionate inaccuracy within certain groups, that indicates that our model is biased.\n",
    "    * For example, if the outcome of this model is going to determine how much resources are spent on investigations, then if a certain group of people are disproportionately mis-predicted, it will have drastic negative impact towards their life. \n",
    "* Assess fairness\n",
    "    * In this section, I will use a permutation test to shuffle feature labels and run the same prediction pipeline.\n",
    "    * If shuffling label doesn't show significant change in prediction outcome, then we can conclude that the model is fair in general.\n",

    "    * Alternative Hypothesis: the model performs differently for those with the same ethnicity and without.\n",
    "    * Significant level: 0.01\n",
    "    * Iterative Process:\n",
    "        * For each iteration, I shuffled the is_same_ethnicity label and repeated the process to obtain observed value. \n",
    "        * I appended all the sampled f1_scores into a list\n",
    "        * I counted the number of f1_scores that are greater than the observed value, took the average and obtained the p-value"

    "# Conclusion & Discussion\n",
    "* Goal: \n",
    "    * The goal of our model was to: \"Predict the outcome of an NYPD allegation based on officer and complainant features\". We created a prediction pipeline from a dataset of roughly 33,000 allegations each recording details about the ethnicity and gender of officer and complainant, age difference, reasons for allegation and the rank of the officer. Through building the baseline model and then expanding to include all the above features, we saw an increase in F-1 score, which indicates that our model performs accurately while balancing false positives and false negatives. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Fairness Evaluation: \n",
    "    * We also performed permutation testing to make sure that the model performs equally well for cases when officer and complainant have the same ethnicity versus cases of different ethnicity. This indicates that, if our model is used to allocated resources or influence the outcome of future allegations, it will not be biased against one case over another. Making sure model is fair is equally important as making sure the model is accurate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Limitation:\n",
    "    * One limitation of our model is that we generalize the outcome of prediction to \"any action taken\" and \"no action taken\" while there are many types of outcome such as arrest, summoned, investigated etc. A further improvement we can make is to make each outcome description a predicted outcome. While it does make the model more fit to the dataset, the resources involved into building the model and the potential outcome of that detailed prediction could be limited. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Impact: \n",
    "    * The impact of this police allegation prediction model demonstrate the potential of data anlysis in government resource allocation. \n",
    "    * NYPD is New York's third largest agency, commanding \\$10.9 Billion in 2020.\n",
    "    * A model that is accurate and fair can be used to allocate funding more efficiently. Especially afte the police protests this year, the funding saved from smart allocation and planning can be used to create more educational program that can impact the society in a long term.\n"
